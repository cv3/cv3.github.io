      <title>Build New Revenue with Remarketing for Search</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remarketing lists for search ads (RLSAs) are a great way to enhance your current Adwords campaigns. They also let you bid on highly competitive keywords that might otherwise be too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend you use RLSAs to capture revenue from site abandoners. When visitors leave your website without making a purchase, use these ads to reconnect with them as they continue searching Google. You can set your bids or select keywords more aggressively since these visitors have recently visited your website and/or shopping cart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two basic strategies we recommend for search ads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimize bids&lt;/em&gt; for your existing keywords or ad groups for those visitors on your remarketing lists. We typically increase our bids at least 100% and in some cases up to 300% when marketing to existing website visitors. This is a great way to be aggressive in the competitive Google Shopping area as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimize Keywords:&lt;/em&gt; You can bid on keywords that you wouldn’t normally include when you’re focused on just shoppers who have recently visited your site. For example, bid on generic keywords only for people who have visited your site in the last 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminder: Unlike Display Remarketing, which only requires 100 cookies before the list can be used, a remarketing list for Google search ads needs to have a minimum number of 1,000 cookies before the list can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Customer Success Story: Kitchen Kettle Village</title>
      <link>https://www.commercev3.com/2016/04/2016-04-15/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2016 16:11:58 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.commercev3.com/2016/04/2016-04-15/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next up in our client success series, we’d like to introduce you to Kitchen Kettle Village (shop.kitchenkettle.com), and its Operations Coach, Chris Dydol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nestled in Lancaster County’s Pennsylvania Dutch Country, Kitchen Kettle has a sweetly charming entrepreneur’s story behind it: Founder Pat Burnley and her husband, Bob, started their business in their garage, preserving jams and jellies. Soon, the garage itself became a tourist attraction, as visitors stopped by to observe the jelly-making process, and enjoy a cup of coffee and a sample of freshly made jellies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, that garage start-up has grown into an expansive shopping destination, with more than 40 retail tenants, including clothing shops, food crafters, artisans, restaurants, and visitor lodging, plus regular food festivals and special events to foster a community experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.commercev3.com/blogimages/kkv-homepage-screenshot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;KitchenKettle.com Home Page&#34; title=&#34;Kitchen Kettle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris shares with us Kitchen Kettle’s eCommerce experience and history with CV3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CV3: How are you selling products today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKV:  The main outlet is a physical shop within our Village of 40 retail shops. We also wholesale products, and obviously sell online via CV3.
What caused you to seek a solution like CommerceV3?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially we were looking for customization of product purchasing method, and being able to have a site that could represent not only our brick and mortar shopping experience, but also our entire Village shopping experience.
CV3: Did your company already have a solution in place? Is there a specific incident that stands out that made it obvious a new solution was needed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We originally had been with CV3, and then considered alternative online shopping vendors upon the suggestion of an external marketing agency.  We quickly realized that other vendors’ platforms were not able to handle our custom requests in a cost efficient manner.
As you searched for a solution, what questions were you looking to have answered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customization – to fit our current shopping experience but also to have the ability to grow as our Village grows.  We were also very concerned with the level of direct support available as we grow.
How long have you been using CommerceV3 at your company at this point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started in 2011, and then begin our “version 2.0” for about 1 month now.
How are you using CommerceV3 in your everyday operations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our online store presence feeds directly into our own internal order processing/fulfillment system.
What features/capabilities do you use the most? Are you leveraging our solution for any interesting/unexpected use cases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantity discounting, recipe suggestions, related product suggestions, and promo code capability.
What overall business benefits have you seen since implementing our solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average order has increased, along with the benefit of having the online shopping experience that resembles the shopping experience in our Village.
What process improvements have you seen, such as fewer mistakes, better data management, reduced time/costs, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve noted less guest confusion in regards to product selection, especially from different size categories.
What improvements have you seen in your services to your own customers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexibility in ordering, improved ease of shopping our various product lines.
What are the company goals that you hope to accomplish in the future that you can share?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued sustainable online sales growth by adding additional “stores” within the site to emulate and enhance our guest’s shopping experience, and expand our online product lines in conjunction with our Village concept.
A big thank you to Kitchen Kettle Village and Chris Dydol for sharing their experiences with us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to share your company’s story, let us know!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;When you have a problem, you will get a knowledgeable person on the phone who will fix your issues the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the platform, the entire company is web-based, meaning everyone works from a space of their own choosing. It’s good for the environment and it helps us get more done, faster!  We are a company of innovators and technology rockstars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;leadership-team&#34;&gt;Leadership Team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blake-ellis&#34;&gt;Blake Ellis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founding Partner &amp;amp; Chief Executive Officer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake Ellis often gets tagged as a “serial entrepreneur”, having been involved in a number of web-based start-ups. Most of his efforts fail spectacularly, but the ones that survive seem to do very well. In addition to CommerceV3, the successes include Rails Machine, Smack Dab Studios, ResEngine, and Timberline Interactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake has won numerous technology awards for CommerceV3 and Rails Machine, including the CBETA Innovation Award and graduation from the Advanced Technology Development Center at Georgia Tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;nathan-focht&#34;&gt;Nathan Focht&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founding Partner &amp;amp; President&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nathan is the heart and soul of CommerceV3, relentlessly driving the platform from its humble beginnings to ever greater heights. He is quick to answer his cell phone, even when things are going wrong, and he’s just as quick to give you a straight and honest answer, even if you were wanting a bit of fluff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More catalog merchant than software developer, Nathan breaks new ground by reinventing tried and true retail techniques to sell more online. He re-envisioned “square inch analysis,” a staple of print catalogs, and brought it into the 21st century for application to online sales. He routinely devises new ways of offering customer segmentation and promo codes, something you will love and hate if you ever have the opportunity to sift through the thousands of permutations available in CV3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nathan has won numerous awards for CommerceV3 and was the driving force behind the 2009 acquisition of Timberline Interactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;certified-secure&#34;&gt;Certified Secure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCI-DSS Compliant platform with Level 1 VISA Certification&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CV3 platform undergoes rigorous and continuous testing by security firms, and the entire platform is certified annually by third party auditors. So CV3 is not only compliant software, but certified software, and it’s certified at the highest level available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fully-automatic&#34;&gt;Fully Automatic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No maintenance, upgrades, or hardware headaches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Licensing software is often just the beginning of your investment, but at CV3 everything is included: software upgrades, bug fixes, firewalls, routers, redundant servers, redundant connections, geographically diverse fail-over, system administrators, pager duty… the list goes on an on. The short version: we take care of everything so you can focus on selling product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;flex-up-down&#34;&gt;Flex Up &amp;amp; Down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add hosting resources for busy times, thin down off-season&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet traffic fluctuates, sometimes on a regular cycle and sometimes because of an external event like a Superbowl ad. At CV3 we have multiple layers of automatic service allocation going on at any given time. New servers spin up as load increases in the morning and then spin down in the middle of the night. New clusters appear as Cyber Monday approaches and stick around as long as they are needed during the holiday season. All this activity means your store always has plenty of bandwidth  for shoppers but you are paying for it when you don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;edge-speed-with-cdn&#34;&gt;Edge Speed with CDN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built-in content delivery network for faster page delivery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speed is a priority at CV3, and milliseconds count. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are built directly into the way CV3 works, so your data is housed as close to the shopper as possible so your site pops into their browser when they visit. And our CDN usage is easy maintain over time, it works in the background so you don’t accidentally put a bunch of product images in the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;redundant-data-centers&#34;&gt;Redundant Data Centers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stores are deployed to virtual data centers for true cloud redundancy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CV3 offers multiple layers of redundancy. Clustered server instances mean your shoppers never see a slow down, even if traffic gets high or a couple of instances decide to crash. And if an entire data center goes down (we’ve seen it happen many times), your stores are replicated across multiple data centers in different geographic regions so you don’t have to worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;top-tier-add-ons&#34;&gt;Top Tier Add-ons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally distributed DNS, mail servers, blog hosting &amp;amp; more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successful storefront needs a whole network of supporting services, and your platform is only as strong as its weakest link. No one will get to your super fancy redundant servers if your DNS provider goes down. At CV3 we partner with top-tier global firms like Amazon, NuStar, Rackspace and Sendgrid to make sure all your supporting services are just as stable as your web store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your continued success is important to both of us, so who better to implement your digital marketing than a company that is vested in your success?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial evaluation of your online marketing goals resulting in a custom crafted plan of initial and long term recommendations. Goal: Increase sales by bringing additional qualiﬁed trafﬁc to your site, and additionally driving a higher conversion rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paid Search (PPC)&lt;/em&gt; – We’ll help you hone and optimize your AdWords advertising to reach your ROI and budget goals. CV3 deliverables may include: key term research, installation of tracking codes, development of multiple campaigns and ad groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remarketing Banner Ads Set up and Installation&lt;/em&gt; – this is an extension of your PPC campaign and shows visitors to your site (who then leave without purchasing) ads when they visit other sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Shopping Submission&lt;/em&gt; – We strongly recommend Google Shopping ads. These ads generate sales and provide good exposure through the prominence given to the shopping results on Google search results pages. CV3 will create a product feed, add Google Analytics tracking codes, and submit it to Google Shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Email campaign suggestions and expert advice&lt;/em&gt; – We’ll make recommendations on how to enhance the design and content of your emails to increase your sales. And then we’ll help you execute those ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Email Template Design/Code&lt;/em&gt; – It takes just a split second for an email recipient to choose whether to engage with an incoming email. CV3 has done extensive research in effective email design and successful deliverability. Our designers use the latest email code standards to ensure the highest rates of deliverability, as well as proven design features to elicit high click through rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Checkout Optimization&lt;/em&gt; – CV3 marketing experts will review and optimize the shopping cart and checkout process with an eye towards removing obstacles to conversion, deleting unneeded form ﬁelds or checkout steps, and adding images or messages that emphasize security and guarantee. We may also adjust button hierarchy and design on each page, create a custom shopping cart header, and remove unnecessary menu links which keep customers from completing the checkout process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search Engine Optimization&lt;/em&gt; – We’ll work to ensure that your website is optimized.  You can also rely on us to provide ongoing guidance on good SEO practices as part of your monthly services. Search engine optimization will include: keyword research, development of title tags, meta descriptions for your home page and category pages, setup of a Google Webmaster Tools account, and submission of your new sitemap to Google and Bing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Analytics Installation and enhancement&lt;/em&gt; – Google Analytics is our analytics platform of choice, and we conﬁgure it for your website. We’ll double check the installed analytics code on the site, and setup checkout goals and funnels and analyze the results as they come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Management&lt;/em&gt; – We will oversee and manage these projects and work with your team to coordinate email dates, PPC scope, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Media guidance&lt;/em&gt; – our team can review your current social media efforts and provide suggestions. Often we can give you recommendations and then provide training to your own staff so they can do the posts.&lt;/p&gt;
