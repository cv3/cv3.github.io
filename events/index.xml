      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remarketing lists for search ads (RLSAs) are a great way to enhance your current Adwords campaigns. They also let you bid on highly competitive keywords that might otherwise be too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend you use RLSAs to capture revenue from site abandoners. When visitors leave your website without making a purchase, use these ads to reconnect with them as they continue searching Google. You can set your bids or select keywords more aggressively since these visitors have recently visited your website and/or shopping cart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two basic strategies we recommend for search ads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimize bids&lt;/em&gt; for your existing keywords or ad groups for those visitors on your remarketing lists. We typically increase our bids at least 100% and in some cases up to 300% when marketing to existing website visitors. This is a great way to be aggressive in the competitive Google Shopping area as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimize Keywords:&lt;/em&gt; You can bid on keywords that you wouldn’t normally include when you’re focused on just shoppers who have recently visited your site. For example, bid on generic keywords only for people who have visited your site in the last 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminder: Unlike Display Remarketing, which only requires 100 cookies before the list can be used, a remarketing list for Google search ads needs to have a minimum number of 1,000 cookies before the list can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
